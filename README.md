Praat Scripts

Tips:
1. Download praat Vocal Toolkit, which is a plugin of praat and has lots of sound manipulation functions
2. Open any praat script - edit - clear history, then start doing weird stuff on your sound/textdgrid files, then go back to praat script - edit - paste history, then you will see the code of all the weird stuff you did. yay!
